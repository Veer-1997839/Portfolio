        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I hold a degree in Mechanical Engineering, which laid the foundation for my strong analytical and problem-solving skills. After completing my engineering studies, I pursued a Postgraduate Diploma in Advanced Computing (DAC) from CDAC, where I further honed my technical expertise. During this program, I had the opportunity to work on a Vehicle Configurator project, which significantly enhanced my practical understanding of software development and system design.

            I possess a diverse skill set that includes proficiency in programming languages such as Java, C++, .NET, and JavaScript, alongside strong knowledge of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). I am also experienced in working with MySQL for database management and have a solid understanding of operating systems. With a passion for technology and continuous learning, I am committed to leveraging my skills to contribute to innovative solutions and deliver high-quality results.</p>
